### Short Abstract
We propose to incorporate transfer learning techniques into a variety of state-of-the-art deep-learning architectures to classify fire photographs to be used in fire monitoring via UAVs. Of the several architectures tested (ResNet-50, SqueezeNet 1.0, AlexNet, ShuffleNet V2, and GoogLeNet), GoogLeNet and ResNet-50 achieved the highest testing and validation accuracies (>96%) under a transfer learning strategy of parameter finetuning. This result corresponds to a significant improvement of over 10% relative to the benchmark performance from previous work.
